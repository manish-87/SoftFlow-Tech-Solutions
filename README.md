## Deployment to Render

This project includes a `render.yaml` configuration file for easy deployment to Render.

### Deploy with one click

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a Render account at https://render.com
3. Click "New" and select "Blueprint" from the Render dashboard
4. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and set up the required services
6. Click "Apply" and wait for the deployment to complete

### Manual Deployment

1. Create a new Web Service in Render
   - Select your GitHub repo
   - Choose "Node" as the Runtime
   - Use these settings:
     - Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build`
     - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Add environment variables:
     - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
     - `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string

2. Create a PostgreSQL database in Render
   - Select "New" → "PostgreSQL" from the Render dashboard
   - Link it to your web service

3. After deployment, run database migrations by clicking "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection issues:

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running on your machine
2. Verify that the database name and credentials in your `.env` file are correct
3. Ensure that the PostgreSQL port is correct (default is 5432)
4. Check if the database has been created:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -c "SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname='softflowtech';"
   ```

### Running Database Migrations

If your database tables are not created properly:

1. Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct `DATABASE_URL`
2. Run the database push command:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
3. Check the console for any errors during migration

### Port Conflicts

If you encounter a port conflict (default is 5000):

1. You can modify the port in `server/index.ts`:
   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Change to another port
   ```
2. Restart the server after changing the port
